 Basics of Web Development

 Excited to share the first experience in my web development journey! ðŸš€

I built a simple personal webpage from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This project helped me learn how to:
Structure pages with HTML
Style content with CSS
Add interactivity with JavaScript (like button alerts)

The page includes an headings, images, links, and interactive elements. It was amazing to bring my first experience to life!
